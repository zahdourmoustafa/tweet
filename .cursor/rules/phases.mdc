    *   Implement additional AI features: Improve Tweet, Make Shorter, Add Emojis, Fix Grammar, Create Hook, Create CTA.
    *   Integrate these features with OpenAI via Vercel AI SDK.
    *   Refine the UI for selecting and applying these AI enhancements.
*   **Sprint 2.2: AI Undetectability & Quality**
    *   Research and implement techniques to make AI-generated content more human-like and less detectable by AI content detectors.
    *   Focus on natural language flow, varied sentence structures, and context-aware phrasing.
    *   Conduct internal testing to validate content originality and copyright compliance.
*   **Sprint 2.3: Content Management & Copy**
    *   Implement functionality to copy the final tweet content to the clipboard.
    *   Develop a basic draft saving mechanism for tweets.

### Deliverables
*   Expanded suite of AI tweet enhancement features.
*   Improved AI content generation quality, focusing on undetectability and originality.
*   Clipboard copy functionality.
*   Draft saving capability.
